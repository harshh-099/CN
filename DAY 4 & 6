Step 0: Enter the CLI (Command Line Interface)
Click the router (R1).

Go to CLI tab.

‚ö° Step 1: Enter Privileged EXEC Mode
Command:

bash
Copy
Edit
enable
(Shortcut: just type en and press Enter)

‚ö° Step 2: Enter Global Configuration Mode
Command:

nginx
Copy
Edit
configure terminal
(Shortcut: just type conf t and press Enter)

‚ö° Step 3: Set Hostname
Command:

nginx
Copy
Edit
hostname R1
You should see the prompt change from Router(config)# to R1(config)#.

‚ö° Step 4: Set an Unencrypted Enable Password
Command:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
enable password CCNA
‚ö° Step 5: Test the Enable Password
Exit to User EXEC Mode: (type exit twice)

bash
Copy
Edit
exit
exit
Now type:

bash
Copy
Edit
enable
It will ask for a password.

Type: CCNA (it won‚Äôt show as you type).

‚úÖ If correct, you enter privileged mode.

‚ö° Step 6: View Running Configuration
Command:

arduino
Copy
Edit
show running-config
(Shortcut: just type sh run and press Enter)

üîé Look for:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
enable password CCNA
(It will be visible in clear text.)

‚ö° Step 7: Encrypt All Passwords
Enter global config again (if not already there):

nginx
Copy
Edit
conf t
Command:

nginx
Copy
Edit
service password-encryption
‚ö° Step 8: View Running Config Again
If still in global config mode, use do:

arduino
Copy
Edit
do show running-config
üîé Now the password is encrypted like 7 0232453A....

‚ö° Step 9: Set a More Secure "Enable Secret" Password
Command:

bash
Copy
Edit
enable secret Cisco
‚ö° Step 10: Test the Enable Secret
Exit twice to user mode:

bash
Copy
Edit
exit
exit
Type:

bash
Copy
Edit
enable
Now test:

Try old password CCNA ‚ûî ‚ùå (doesn't work).

Try new password Cisco ‚ûî ‚úÖ (works).

‚ö° Step 11: View Passwords Again
Command:

arduino
Copy
Edit
show running-config
üîé See:

enable password 7 ******** (weak encryption)

enable secret 5 ******** (strong MD5 encryption)

‚ö° Step 12: Save Configuration
Command options: (you can use any one)

arduino
Copy
Edit
write
or

arduino
Copy
Edit
write memory
or

arduino
Copy
Edit
copy running-config startup-config
‚úÖ Now your settings are saved even if you power off the router!

Ethernet LAN Switching Lab (Jeremy‚Äôs IT Lab ‚Äì Summary)
Network Setup:

2 switches (SW1, SW2)

2 PCs connected to each switch (PC1, PC2, PC3, PC4)

Initial Condition:

Empty MAC address tables on switches

Empty ARP tables on PCs

Step-by-Step Summary:
Step 1: PC1 pings PC3

PC1 needs PC3's MAC address ‚Üí sends ARP request (broadcast).

Devices receiving ARP request: All devices (except PC1) ‚Äî PC2, PC3, PC4, SW1, SW2.

PC3 sends ARP reply (unicast) back to PC1.

PC1 updates ARP table ‚Üí sends ICMP Echo Request (unicast) to PC3.

PC3 replies with ICMP Echo Reply (unicast) to PC1.

Windows PCs send 4 pings by default (Cisco devices send 5).

Step 2: Use Simulation Mode in Packet Tracer

Go to Simulation Mode ‚Üí

Click PC1 ‚Üí Desktop ‚Üí Command Prompt ‚Üí Type ping 192.168.1.3.

Observation:

ARP broadcast sent first (destination MAC = ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff).

ARP reply unicast sent back.

Then ICMP Echo Request and Reply (unicast).

Step 3: Generate More Network Traffic

Ping from PC2 to PC4 (ping 192.168.1.4).

Purpose: Allow switches to learn all MAC addresses.

Step 4: Identify MAC Addresses using Show Commands

On SW1:

Use enable ‚Üí show mac address-table.

Identify MACs based on connected interfaces (FastEthernet 0/1, 0/2).

Only sees PC3 and PC4 behind GigabitEthernet0/1 (not directly which MAC belongs to which).

On SW2:

Use enable ‚Üí show mac address-table.

Can directly identify PC3 (Fa0/1) and PC4 (Fa0/2) MAC addresses.

Step 5: Clear Dynamic MAC Addresses

On each switch (SW1 and SW2):

Use clear mac address-table dynamic.

Then verify with show mac address-table (should be empty).

Extra Notes:
ARP request = broadcast.

ARP reply = unicast.

ICMP ping and reply = unicast.

Switches learn MAC addresses by examining source MAC of incoming frames.

Packet Tracer limitation: Cannot selectively clear a specific MAC address, must clear all.
